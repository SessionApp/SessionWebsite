                <h2>IX.	 Sessions Feature</h2>
                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5" style="text-align:justify">The system of the “Sessions” was thought in order to put in relation the people wishing to practice with several a certain sport that it is between friends (private) or between unknowns (public). Everything that has been written previously (in the part VIII about the Community forums) is also valid in this section. While Session strives to encourage a respectful member experience, Session is not responsible for the conduct of any member on or off the Service. You agree to exercise caution in all of your interactions with other members, especially if you choose to interact outside of the Service or meet in person to engage in any activity through the "Sessions" feature. You understand that Session does not conduct criminal background checks on its members or otherwise investigate the backgrounds of its members. Session makes no representations or warranties regarding the conduct of members. THUS, YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS. 
                </p>
                
                <h2>X. Spot Details Feature</h2>
                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5" style="text-align:justify">Users of Session App are responsible for themselves. Indeed, Session is built to help people find places (and meet people while practicing) their sports and their activities. Session cannot safely make a decision about when/where/with whom to practice. Session is designed only to help YOU make YOUR decision. YOU MUST MAKE THE FINAL DECISION TO PRACTICE OR NOT TO PRACTICE!
                    No responsibility is taken for the accuracy or correctness of the information contained on Session in particular about the spots added by our users. Although Session does its best to have correct information about their spots, especially through the creation of the spot validation system by our team : However, it is possible that some spots have incorrect information. Users are requested to put real information about the spots where to practice, otherwise it can be dangerous for a user who wants to practice on this spot. Moreover, Session reserves the right to change spots’ information and to use photos that a user could upload to show the spot.
                    In no event will Session be liable for any damages, including without limitation direct or indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages, fatality, injury, accident, losses or expenses arising in connection with the use of the App or any linked site or use thereof or inability to use by any party, or in connection with any failure of performance, error, omission, interruption, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer virus or line or system failure, even if Session, or representatives thereof, are advised of the possibility of such damages, losses or expenses. By the way, Session suggests that you always wear safety gear, such as helmets, knee pads or other safety sport-specific equipment when riding. 
                    The information and materials contained in the Session App, including text (In particular every spots’ description), graphics, links or other items are provided "as is", "as available". Session does not warrant the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of this information and materials and expressly disclaims liability for errors or omissions in this information and materials. No warranty of any kind, implied, expressed or statutory including but not limited to the warranties of non-infringement of third-party rights, title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and freedom from computer virus, is given in conjunction with the information and materials. Moreover, the users of the site give Session the rights of reproduction, modification and use of the contents relating to the spots which they post on the Session App: information and pictures of the spots, without limitation of duration in time and on all supports.
                    In order to offer users up-to-date and accurate information, Session reserves the right to rectify or delete all data on the app, and to moderate inappropriate content as well as to delete the profiles of members who do not respect these terms of use. Each user can report an inappropriate spot via the report abuse link at the top of the page of a spot detail. A spot cannot be deleted by its creator. If he has serious and valid reasons to want to delete a spot he created, he can contact the Session Team by email (team@app-session.com). The request will be treated exceptionally and case by case requests.
                    Furthermore, by registering, you agree not to deface the spaces listed. Don't leave trash on the spot or in the forest.  You should always take a trash bag with you. You must show respect for local riders and their eventual man-made structures or playgrounds. Spot can be demolished because of your carelessness. 
                    </p> 
                
                <h2>XI.	Map features</h2>
                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5" style="text-align:justify">Indeed, a point on which the Session Team works a lot is not to jeopardize the spots, not to degrade them but to preserve them in time. For this purpose, a system of "secret spots" has been set up. Only people who have been verified by 5 verified people of a certain sport will be able to access those “secrets spots” of this sport.
                    The geolocation on the map of the spots allows one to be aware of the spots in the vicinity, especially on the drop-down list of spots, highlighting the spots in the vicinity where you can practice your sport. The Session App uses your geolocation only to enhance your user experience and to compile statistics about the use of our services. Under no circumstances will Session App use your usage data for commercial purposes, especially your location.
                    </p>
                <h2>XII. Place of trial and compensation</h2>
                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5" style="text-align:justify">Except for members residing in the European Union or the European Economic Area, who may bring their actions in their country of residence in accordance with applicable law, and except for actions that may be brought in a local court of competent jurisdiction, all actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Service, or your relationship with Tinder that for any reason are not subject to arbitration shall be litigated exclusively in the courts of Paris, France. You and Session consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction in the courts of the French state and waive any claim that such courts are an inconvenient forum.
 
                    </p>
                <br>
                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5" style="text-align:justify">
                    Finally, each User acknowledges that he is responsible for his own use of the Session App and for the consequences of such use. Each user agrees to the extent permitted by applicable law, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Session, their affiliate from and against any and all claims, demands, damages, losses, costs, liabilities and expenses, including attorneys' fees due to, arising out of, or in any way related to your access to or use of the Service, your Content, or your violation of this Agreement.</p>
